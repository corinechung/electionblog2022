<h1>Blog Extension 1: Comparing Midterm Forecasts</h1>
<p>** FiveThirtyEight Model</p>
<p>FiveThirtyEight utilizes three different versions of models: Lite, Classic, and Deluxe. These versions, however, can be considered to be layers that build on top of one another. For instance, the Lite version incorporates district-by-district polling (adjusted for house effects and other factors) and CANTOR, which is a system that infers results for districts with little or no polling from comparable districts that do have polling data available. The next version, Classic, includes all of the aspects of the Lite version, while also implementing fundamentals, or non-polling factors such as fundraising, incumbency, and past election results that historically have helped in predicting congressional races. Finally, the Deluxe version includes all of the aforementioned layers while adding expert forecasts, which are ratings of each race published by the Cook Political Report, Inside Elections, and Sabato’s Crystal Ball.</p>
<p>FiveThirtyEight also takes into account a variety of other factors. When collecting polls, FiveThirtyEight also includes partisan polls, but ensures that the polls they gather meet some criteria. For instance, they will not use polls that have a significant concern about the veracity nor will they use polls that have been commissioned by nonprofessional hobbyists.</p>
<p>Polls are also weighted based on the sample size, the recency, and their pollster rating. There are also three adjustments made to each poll: a likely voter adjustment, a timeline adjustment, and a house effects adjustment. Moreover, FiveThirtyEight’s model accounts for the possibility of a uniform national swing, which is when the polls are systematically favoring one party’s direction in almost every race.</p>
<p>** Economist Model</p>
<p>The Economist seems to use some similar approaches that FiveThirtyEight uses. For example, the Economist also has models to assess fundamentals, which include previous election results and campaign contributions.</p>
<p>However, one main difference is that the Economist seems to place more of an emphasis on the generic ballot as opposed to a variety of polling measures that is used by FiveThirtyEight. Besides using fundamentals to build on this model, the Economist also takes into account the popularity of the president and partisan lean when determining their voting-based predictors.</p>
<p>After examining the political climate on a national level, the Economist then looks at district-level data. For each district, there are two considerations: voting history and information about the candidates. Then, two nationwide factors are added: the share of swing voters in the electorate and observed, adjusted national popular vote. One additional consideration is that given district-level votes do not follow a normal distribution, the Economist uses a skew-T distribution.</p>
<p>** Conclusion</p>
<p>Though I believe that both methods have their merits, I believe that the Economist’s method is more precise because it emphasizes the generic ballot more so than local polling, which may be subject to more bias and variation. FiveThirtyEight says that they use partisan polls, which are a “necessary evil,” since there is no way to avoid them for the House. Though I wonder if FiveThirtyEight has a way of weighing their polls based on pollster ratings.</p>
