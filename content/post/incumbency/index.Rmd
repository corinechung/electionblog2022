In this blog post, I examine Extension #1 to see how accurate 
the expert predictions were in 2018. I do this by visualizing actual voteshare (seatshare) and comparing this to the predictions.

# Map of Voteshare

My visualization of the predicted Republican voteshare is shown below. The more blue a district is, the greater the Democrat win was. Alternatively, the more red a district is, the stronger the Republican win was. A purple categorization is indicative of a toss up.

```{r map of voteshare, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = data_18, aes(fill=RepVotesMajorPercent, geometry=geometry),
          inherit.aes=FALSE, alpha=0.9) + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red", limits = c(0,90)) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-175, -70), ylim = c(25, 75), expand = FALSE) +  
  theme_void() +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank())+
  labs(fill = 'Republican Voteshare',title = 'Republican Voteshare by District for the 2018 Election')
```

# Actual Results

I then compare these voteshare values to the actual results.

```{r compare, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
data_18 %>%
  filter(!is.na(avg_rating)) %>%
  group_by(Avg_rating_code) %>%
  summarise('Dem_Win' = sum(winner_party == 'D'),
            'Rep_Win' = sum(winner_party == 'R'),
            Dem_pct = Dem_Win/(Dem_Win + Rep_Win),
            Rep_pct = Dem_Win/(Dem_Win + Rep_Win)) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 3)) %>%
  htmlTable(title = 'Results')
```

The table shows that expert predictions based on incumbency status were relatively accurate. Disregarding the 28 toss-up races, only 5 out of the 107 other races resulted in the other party winning the election - 3 of these were Democratic wins in Lean Republican districts and 3 of these were Democratic wins in likely Republican districts.
