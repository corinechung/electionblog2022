      <description>Blog Extension 1: Comparing Midterm Forecasts ** FiveThirtyEight Model
FiveThirtyEight utilizes three different versions of models: Lite, Classic, and Deluxe. These versions, however, can be considered to be layers that build on top of one another. For instance, the Lite version incorporates district-by-district polling (adjusted for house effects and other factors) and CANTOR, which is a system that infers results for districts with little or no polling from comparable districts that do have polling data available.</description>

      <description>This blog is part of a series related to Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard University taught by Professor Ryan D. Enos.
From now until November 8, I will be updating this weekly blog series with my 2022 US midterm election prediction model. For this second blog, I explore national economic models as predictors for the incumbent partyâ€™s popular vote percentage in a given election year.
Real Disposable Income Quarterly First, I examine the percent change in disposable income and how that correlates with the percentage of the votes that the incumbent party receives for each election year from 1964 to 2020.</description>
